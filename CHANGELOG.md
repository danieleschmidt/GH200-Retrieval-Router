## Migration Guides

### Upgrading to v1.0.0

When v1.0.0 is released, migration from pre-release versions will require:

1. **Configuration Changes**:
   - Update memory pool configurations
   - Migrate to new authentication system
   - Update monitoring endpoint configurations

2. **API Changes**:
   - New semantic routing API endpoints
   - Enhanced vector database management APIs
   - Improved metrics and health check endpoints

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Migrate to optimized memory layouts
   - Update NVLink communication patterns
   - Implement new caching strategies

### Breaking Changes

We will maintain backward compatibility within major versions, but breaking changes may occur between major versions:

- **v0.x to v1.0**: Configuration format changes, API endpoint restructuring
- **v1.x to v2.0**: Potential Grace Hopper architecture updates, new indexing formats
