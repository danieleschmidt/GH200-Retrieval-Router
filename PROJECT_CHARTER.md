# GH200-Retrieval-Router Project Charter

## Project Overview

### Project Name
GH200-Retrieval-Router

### Project Summary
Develop a high-performance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system specifically optimized for NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip architecture, enabling real-time inference over massive vector databases (20TB+) with unprecedented performance and scale.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
Large-scale RAG applications face critical performance bottlenecks:
- **Memory Bandwidth Limitations**: Traditional PCIe connections limit data transfer to 32 GB/s
- **Memory Fragmentation**: Separate CPU/GPU memory spaces require expensive data copying
- **Scale Limitations**: Existing solutions cannot efficiently handle 20TB+ vector databases
- **Latency Issues**: Current systems struggle to achieve sub-100ms query latencies at scale
- **Cost Inefficiency**: Poor hardware utilization leads to high operational costs

### Market Opportunity
- **Growing RAG Adoption**: 300% year-over-year growth in enterprise RAG deployments
- **Data Scale Explosion**: Average vector database sizes growing 10x annually
- **Performance Demands**: Real-time applications requiring sub-50ms response times
- **Hardware Evolution**: Grace Hopper architecture enables new performance paradigms
